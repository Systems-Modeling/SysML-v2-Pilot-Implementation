= SysML v2 Release Eclipse Installation

*Requirements:* Eclipse 2024-03 (4.31), with Java Development Kit

(*Note:* The release may work on later versions of Eclipse, but it has only been tested on 2024-03.)

== Installing the plugins

. Open an Eclipse workspace.
. Select `Help > Install New Software`.
. Select `Add...` and then, in the add dialog, select `Archive...` .
. Navigate to the `org.omg.sysml.site.zip` archive and select it. (You can give it a name if you wish.) Click `Add`.
. In the Install window, select the `KerML and SysML Editors` category and click `Next`.
. Continue with the installation (select `Install Anyway` if asked), and, when it is complete, restart Eclipse.

== Installing PlantUML graphical visualization

Graphical visualization is available in Eclipse using the open source https://plantuml.com[PlantUML] tooling to render diagrams.

. Make sure that your Eclipse has PlantUML with SysMLv2 extensions. You can install it from the update site of https://github.com/himi/p2-update-puml-sysmlv2/raw/main/updates with Help > Install New Software
. PlantUML visualization requires that https://www.graphviz.org[GraphViz] be installed. Visit https://www.graphviz.org/download/
and download the appropriate package for your environment.
 ** The recommended GraphViz version is 2.44.1.  Make sure you have initialized GraphViz with `dot -c` command.  See https://plantuml.com/ja/graphviz-dot for details.
. If Eclipse cannot automatically find the path to the GraphViz executable, you can set it by going to `Preferences > PlantUML`.

== Installing the model library and modeling projects

If you are updating an existing installation of an earlier SysML v2 release, then, before proceeding with the procedure
below, delete the `kerml`, `sysml` and `sysml.library` projects from your workspace, selecting `Delete project contents from disk`.

. Select `File > Import`.
. Under `General`, choose `Existing Projects into Workspace`.
. Browse to the `sysml.library` directory and select it.
. Under `Projects`, select `sysml.library`, under `Options` select `Copy projects into workspace`, then click `Finish`. 
  (If Eclipse asks whether to "overwrite settings", select `No`.)
. Turn off `Project > Build Automatically`, then select `Project > Clean...` and build _only_ `sysml.library`.
. Repeat the above steps for the `kerml` and `sysml` projects.

*Important Note:* Import the `kerml` and `sysml` projects _only_ after importing and building the `sysml.library` project.

After installation is complete, if you wish to turn `Build Automatically` back on, first go to `Preferences > General > Workspace > Build`
and make sure that `sysml.library` is before `kerml` and `sysml` in the build order.

== Working with model files

. Double click on a file with a `.kerml` or `.sysml` extension to view it in a Kernel Modeling Language (KerML) or Systems Modeling Language (SysML).
. Create new KerML files in the `kerml/src` directory with the extension `.kerml`.
. Create new SysML files in the `sysml/src` directory with the extension `.sysml`.
. You can view the model library files in the `sysml.library` project, but _do not change them_.
. To show SysML diagrams, in `Window > Show View > Other...` select the PlantUML view. The diagram rendered in the view is relative to the text selected
in the active SysML editor view. Tree (BDD-like), interconnection (IBD-like) and state machine views are currently supported.

*Release Note:* While performance has improved further in this release, there are still cases in which the processing of a file with
several name resolution errors can take a long time, particularly if the `Quantities and Units` library is being used.

== Initializing new model projects

You can also create a separate project for your KerML or SysML files.

. Select `+File > New > Project...+` to open the New Project wizard.
. Select `General/Project`.
. Enter the project name (and location if necessary), then press Next.
. On the Project References page, check the `sysml.library` project. This step tells Eclipse which other projects should be visible for resolving cross-references.
. Right-click the new project and select `Configure > Convert` to an Xtext project. This step sets up the indexing infrastructure necessary for resolving references between different files.
. Create any text files with `.kerml` or `.sysml` extensions to start working with a new file.

NOTE: Adding the project references to an existing project can be done in the project Properties dialog available from the popup menu on the project in the Project References page.

NOTE: If the Xtext setup (step 5) is missed, opening the KerML or SysML editor shows a dialog asking to convert the project to an Xtext project.
Accepting this has the same results as manually selecting the menu item on the project.
